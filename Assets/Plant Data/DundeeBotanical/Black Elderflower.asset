  - Derived from the Sambucus nigra tree, Black Elderflower is notable for its clusters
    of tiny cream-white flowers, which are as fragrant as they are beautiful. These
    flowers give way to small black or dark blue berries. Cultivated across Europe
    and North America for its visual appeal and versatility, elderflower is also
    steeped in folklore, often symbolizing protection and health. It is renowned
    for enhancing immune function, particularly against colds and flu, and for its
    effectiveness in treating respiratory conditions due to its anti-inflammatory
    and antiviral properties
  plantEffects:
  - Immune Support
