  plantSentences:
  - All parts of raw monkshood plants are extremely poisonous. Most severe poisonings
    happen as a result of ingesting monkshood, but you can also easily absorb the
    poison through the skin. While monkshood does have some therapeutic benefits,
    it doesn't take much to cause poisoning.
