  sentences:
  - "Ah, you have arrived, brave one. I am the Elder Dryad, guardian of these botanical
    gardens for countless generations. But alas, my time as caretaker is drawing
    to a close. The winds of change whisper to me that the garden must have a new
    guardian\u2014a healer who will learn its secrets and use its gifts to aid those
    in need."
  - "You have been chosen because you possess a heart both curious and kind. This
    world of botanical wonders is not just a sanctuary for plants, but a source of
    healing. However, a great tragedy has befallen this place. A mysterious ailment
    has struck the inhabitants of the land\u2014patients who lie scattered across
    the map, sick, unconscious, and in desperate need of help."
  - But beware, for not all plants are what they seem. Among the many that offer
    healing, some harbor deadly poisons. You must learn to discern between them,
    for the wrong choice could lead to dire consequences.
  - Begin with the garden, child. It will teach you, as it taught me. Study the plants,
    learn their properties, and remember that every leaf, every petal, holds a story.
    The fate of those afflicted lies in your hands. Now, go forth, and may the wisdom
    of the garden guide you.
  - "And remember\u2026"
  - Not all is as it seems.
